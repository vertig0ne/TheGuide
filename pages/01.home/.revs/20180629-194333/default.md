## Welcome

!! **PLEASE NOTE** This is currently a work in progress and may not even be complete.

So welcome to LearnToServe. This is pretty much a guide to doing anything with a Media Server. Having a Media Server has become very much a hot topic over the last few years and is very quickly taking shape. The hardest part with it is that most people don't have a tech guru on standby with bundles of spare time to devote to you and your mission. This is exactly where we come in, we are the tech guru's that you would call and while we (probably) would love to spend hours setting it all up for you, we have lives too. 

So we come to LearnToServe, It focuses on each element of designing or managing a media server but is not a step-by-step guide. Although it may be capable of being used as a step-by-step guide this will not be its main purpose. LearnToServe is more of an idea/solution center, you come to us with an idea and we provide options and solutions on how to implement it.

## Where to Start?

To start off, we would recommend the 'Basics' page as this will explain some of the assumptions we make during the process; it also includes some basic things you should know. Going off from there would depend on which path you want to take. If you are just starting out with a media server we recommend looking at [Local Storage Solutions](/storage-solutions/) to decide on an oprating system, then installing and configuring your server/ingestion/management software. And finally making it all neat and tidy with the Frontend section.
