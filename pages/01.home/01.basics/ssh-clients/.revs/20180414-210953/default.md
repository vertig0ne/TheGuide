SSH is the preferred way to gain Secure Shell access to a machine, essentially opening a terminal on the client to perform actions on the host.

## What client to use
Depending on the OS on the machine you want to manage your server with, there is a lot of different clients, ranging from just a terminal, to a more feature rich client. Some OSes even come with a preinstalled client.

This guide should help you choose a client.

## Linux

## Windows
At the time of writing, Windows doesnâ€™t come with native SSH support, therefore we need to download a third party client.

### MobaXTerm
[MobaXTerm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) is a versatile client, supporting most of your admin needs. It helps you stay organized, by saving credentials (Max. 12 sessions in the free versions) which you can put in folders. You can have multiple sessions open, as tabs. It also brings some Linux commands to Windows, like ls, grep and other popular commands.
