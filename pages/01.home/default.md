## Welcome

So welcome to "The Guide" (name pending). This is pretty much a guide to doing anything with a Media Server. Having a Media Server has become very much a hot topic over the last few years and is very quickly taking shape. The hardest part with it, is that most people don't have a tech guru on standby with bundles of spare time to devote to you and your mission. This is exactly where we come in, we are the tech guru's that you would call and while we (probably) would love to spend hours setting it all up for you. We want our lives too. 


So we come to this. "The Guide". It's designed to be conerntrated on each element and not a step-by-step guide. There are plans allow us to generate into a step-by-step guide beginning to end, but in order for the most people to be able to just look at this site and go "That's the bit I want" in that magic "I've finally found the answer" moment, we opted to do it this way. 

### Where to Start?

To start off with we would recommend the "Basics" page as this will explain some of the assumptions we make during the process it also includes some basic "things you should know" from there will depend on you and which path you will take. If you are just starting out, we would recommend looking at Local Storage Solutions to get an operating system installed, then installing your server/ingestion/management software. Then finally making it all neat and tidy with the Frontend section.
