## Welcome

!! **PLEASE NOTE** This is currently a work in progress and may not even be complete.

So welcome to "The Guide" (name pending). This is pretty much a guide to doing anything with a Media Server. Having a Media Server has become very much a hot topic over the last few years and is very quickly taking shape. The hardest part with it is that most people don't have a tech guru on standby with bundles of spare time to devote to you and your mission. This is exactly where we come in, we are the tech guru's that you would call and while we (probably) would love to spend hours setting it all up for you, we have lives too. 

So we come to "The Guide", It focuses on each element of designing or managing a media server but is not a step-by-step guide. Although it may be capable of being used as a step-by-step guide this will not be its main purpose. "The Guide" is more of an idea/solution center, you come to us with idea and we provide options and solutions on how to implement it.

## Where to Start?

To start off with we would recommend the "Basics" page as this will explain some of the assumptions we make during the process it also includes some basic "things you should know" from there will depend on you and which path you will take. If you are just starting out, we would recommend looking at Local Storage Solutions to get an operating system installed, then installing your server/ingestion/management software. Then finally making it all neat and tidy with the Frontend section.
