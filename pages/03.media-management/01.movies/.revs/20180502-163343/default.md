[TOC]

Hollywood.... They know how to produce good movies right? Right. One of the heavily popular types of content people love to serve. You love having a giant Blu-ray collection but don't want to damage your collection taking the disks in and out of cases constantly and trying to forward those unskippable commercials. Serving them with all of that already stipped out is the way forward my friend. Well... these applications manage your library, making sure files are in the correct places and giving you a good idea of what is coming and when.
