[TOC]

Having somewhere to put all this data would be a good idea right? Well.... Yeah, but we aren't going into delve too much into this, if you check out the [Chat](/home/chat) page for the communities that supported us while building the guide where they can specialize further as to your needs and your requirements.

## Local Storage

Obviously local storage is 100% necessary, cloud drives are great for backups and data that is accessed infrequently, but the internet connection necessary to maintain and cloud drives ingestion limitations should always keep the bulk of it local. I think as it's media we can all agree that we don't need full on RAID capabilties and complicate our situation even further, but we do need some kind of protection in case one of the drives dies. 

## Cloud Storage

Cloud Storage is the "next big thing", if you have the internet connection and enough money, we have been feeling a lot more peaceful with our data backed up, so should anything go completely wrong with our setup and send us back to nothing. We have a backup we can use to bring us back, without having to start back at ripping our first DVD. 

While our guide could be adapted to use Cloud Drives more than we do, however we still have concerns over these services for the next few years, so in no way recommend using a Cloud Drive as your primary source of storage.
