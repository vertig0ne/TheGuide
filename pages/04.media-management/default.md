[TOC]

Management of media is a very important task and is essential to automating the process. Even the Media Servers require that files be named appropriately and placed in certain path structures in order to be detected and have metadata grabbed for it and every Media Server is slightly different with this naming process. Fortunately there is software out there to do it for us. A short while ago we only had 1 option for each element, most of the time no options whatsoever, but now we have usually 2 options for each media type with very few types remaining to bring into the fold. In the tables below you will find brief comparisons of each app in their respective fields
