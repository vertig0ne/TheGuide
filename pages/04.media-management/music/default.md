It's great isn't it? Headphones on, Music playing, ready to start your journey right. Spotify and services like that do aliviate some of the pressure on our extra-ordinary tastes but eventually, you have the CD, you have it on PC, you want it on your phone. You don't need it occupying space on your phone. The problem comes when you realise the mess of your Music library. Media Servers really don't like this. However, these apps down there manage it for you to varying degrees of reliability. Check them out and make your decision
