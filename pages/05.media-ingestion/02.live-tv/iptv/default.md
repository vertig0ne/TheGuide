[TOC]

Using IPTV as a source for Live TV has many benefits such as you do not need any extra physical hardware to actually be able to use it. Lots of providers prodvide apps already in this case for you to watch TV on your phone while not home. However one of the major downsides is that it can work out one of the more expensive options (although usually still cheaper than DVB-S) and most packages only allow you to tune into 1 channel at a time. Where as both DVB options allow you to watch to all channels on the same frequency with no extra effort.
